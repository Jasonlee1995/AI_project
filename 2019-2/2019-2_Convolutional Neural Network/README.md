# 2019-2 Convolutional Neural Network


### Project Description

- Predict label using Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network
- Use tetris dataset
- Use pytorch framework


### Details

> I. Preparation  
>> - Make tetris dataset  
>> - Visualize dataset

> II. Multilayer Perceptron
>> - Plot test accuracy

> III. Convolutional Neural Network
>> - Plot test accuracy
>> - Measure test accuracy

> IV. Properties of CNN
>> - Confirm that CNN is more translation-invariant than MLP by comparing test accuracies of TetrisCNN1 to TetrisMLP model
>> - Verify that CNN1 model is sensitive to scale and rotation
